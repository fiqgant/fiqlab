You’ll learn about the basic Python syntax so that you can get started with the Python language quickly.

## Whitespace and indentation
If you've worked with other programming languages like Java, C#, or C/C++, you're aware that the statements in such languages are separated by semicolons (;).

Python, on the other hand, builds the code structure using whitespace and indentation.

The following Python code sample demonstrates:

```Python
def main():
    i = 1
    max = 100
    while (i < max):
        print(i)
        i = i + 1

# call function main 
main()
```

You don't need to know the code's meaning right now. Please focus on the organization of the code.

There is no semicolon to mark the conclusion of the sentence at the end of each line. Additionally, the code is formatted using indentation.

The following benefits of organizing Python code with indentation and whitespace:
- Unlike in other programming languages like Java or C#, you won't ever miss the starting or ending code of a block.
- The coding style is also largely consistent. The code of one developer is identical to yours if you have to maintain it.
- compared to other programming languages, the code is easier to read and understand.

## Comments
Because they explain why a piece of code was produced, the comments are just as crucial as the code itself.

The comments are ignored by the Python interpreter when it runs the code.

A single line comment in Python starts with the hash symbol (#), which is followed by the comment. For instance:

```python
# This is a single line comment in Python
```

And Python also support other kinds of comments.

## Continuation of statements
Statements in Python are separated by a newline character. Each statement is given its own line.

However, by utilizing the backslash () character, a lengthy statement might span numerous lines.

The backslash () character is used to continue a sentence in the second line, as shown in the example below:

```python
if (a == True) and (b == False) and \
   (c == True):
    print("Continuation of statements")
```

## Identifiers
Identifiers are names that identify variables, functions, modules, classes, and other objects in Python.

An identifier's name must begin with a letter or an underscore (_). After that, only underscores or alphanumeric characters are allowed.

Identifiers in Python are case-sensitive. For instance, the IDs the counter and Counter are distinct.

Additionally, you cannot name identifiers in Python using keywords.

## Keywords
In Python, several terms have unique definitions. They're known as keywords.

The list of Python keywords is as follows:

```Python
False      class      finally    is         return
None       continue   for        lambda     try
True       def        from       nonlocal   while
and        del        global     not        with
as         elif       if         or         yield
assert     else       import     pass
break      except     in         raise
```

Python is a growing and evolving language. So its keywords will keep increasing and changing.

Python provides a special module for listing its keywords called keyword. 

To find the current keyword list, you use the following code:

```python
import keyword

print(keyword.kwlist) 
```

## String literals
To indicate a string literal in Python, you can use single quotes ('), double quotes ("), triple single quotes ("'), and triple double quotes (""").

The string literal must have the same kind of quotations all around it. For instance, if you begin a string literal with a single quote, you must also end it with a single quote.

Examples of string literals are shown below:

```python
s = 'This is a string'
print(s)
s = "Another string using double quotes"
print(s)
s = ''' string can span multiple line '''
print(s)
```

## Summary
- A Python statement ends with a newline character.
- Python's code structure is organized using spaces and identation.
- In Python, identifiers are names used to designate variables, functions, modules, classes, etc.
- Commentary explains how the code functions. The Python interpreter understands them.
- To indicate something, enclose it in a single quote, double-quotes, tripple-quotes, or tripple double-quotes.
