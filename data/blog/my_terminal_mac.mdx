I just got my Macbook Pro (M2) two days ago. So today I will transform my terminals into a wonderful, colorful, supportive terminal that offers suggestions and has a memory, we'll do it by [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and design it by [PowerLevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k).

# Install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
in the command line type

```zsh:Terminal
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

# [PowerLevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
Install Powerlevel10k using the following command

```console
git clone https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/powerlevel10k
```

Then you need to enable it, change the value of ZSH_THEME to following in `~/.zshrc` file :

```console
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
```

## Configure Powerlevel10k Theme
I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) as my terminal and make sure your terminal font is [Hack NF](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)

<div className="grid place-items-center">
  <img
    className="inline rounded-lg"
    src="https://iterm2.com/img/logo2x.jpg"
    alt="term"
    width="1920"
    height="1920"
  />
</div>

### p10k configure
type

```console
p10k configure
```

<div className="grid place-items-center">
  <img
    className="inline rounded-lg"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--71QSuVWr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/xf9fk2sgux1niog4vhpy.gif"
    alt="term"
    width="1920"
    height="1920"
  />
</div>

you can choose your style...

## Plugins (Optional, Good to have!)
### Clone plugins
#### zsh-syntax-highlighting
It enables highlighting of commands whilst they are typed at a zsh prompt into an interactive terminal. This helps in reviewing commands before running them, particularly in catching syntax errors.

```console
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

#### zsh-autosuggestions
It suggests commands as you type based on history and completions.

```console
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

#### ls tools
colorls: A Ruby script that colorizes the ls output with color and icons
colorls

```console
sudo gem install colorls
```

### Activate the plugins
In `~/.zshrc` file replace the line starting with plugins=() to below line.

```console
plugins=( git zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions )
```

```console
if [ -x "$(command -v colorls)" ]; then
    alias ls="colorls"
    alias la="colorls -al"
fi
```

Some more official plugins - [ohmyzsh plugins](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins)

after all these steps type

```console
source ~/.zshrc
```

Finally it should be like this ðŸ‘‡
