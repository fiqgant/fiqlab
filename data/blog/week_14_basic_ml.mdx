## Introduction
The field of machine learning is rapidly evolving, and new tools and frameworks are constantly being developed to facilitate the implementation of complex algorithms. In this week, students will be introduced to the most popular machine learning libraries and frameworks, including Python, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn.

## Objectives
- To familiarize students with the most common machine learning libraries and frameworks.
- To provide a basic understanding of the capabilities and limitations of these tools.
- To give students practical experience working with these tools through hands-on exercises.

## Outline Lesson
### Lesson 1: Introduction to machine learning libraries and frameworks
- Overview of Python, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn
- Key features and benefits of each tool
- Limitations and considerations when choosing a too

### Lesson 2: Hands-on exercises
- Installing and setting up the tools
- Basic usage and syntax for each tool
- Practical applications of the tools, including working with sample datasets

## Activities
- Students will complete a set of exercises designed to give them hands-on experience with each tool.
- Students will work with sample datasets and apply the tools to solve a variety of machine learning problems.
- Students will present their results and findings to the class, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each tool and the implications for their use in different scenarios.
