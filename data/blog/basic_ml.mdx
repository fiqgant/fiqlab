summary: The general idea of machine learning is to get a model to learn trends from historical data on any topic and be able to reproduce those trends on comparable data in the future.

The general goal of machine learning is to train a model to recognize patterns in any type of historical data so that it can repeat those patterns on similar data in the future. Hereâ€™s a diagram outlining the basic machine learning process :

This graph shows a machine learning model that has been fitted to historical data. The initial observations, which included measurements for height, width, and shape, are shown on the left. Triangles, crosses, and stars make up the forms.

Different parts of the graph include the shapes. You can see how those initial observations were converted into a decision rule on the right. You need to know the width and the height of a new observation in order to identify which square it belongs in. What shape it will most likely take depends on which square it falls in.

For this objective, several different models might be applied. A mathematical formula that can be used to describe data points is called a model. The linear model, which employs a linear function denoted by the equation y = ax + b, is one instance.

When you estimate or fit a model, an algorithm is used to determine the best values for the fixed parameters. The parameters of the linear model are a and b. Fortunately, you won't need to create these estimating algorithms from scratch to get started. They have already been found by outstanding mathematicians.

Once the model has been estimated, it may be used as a mathematical formula to forecast the values of your target variable by entering values for your independent variables. From a high level, that is everything that occurs!
