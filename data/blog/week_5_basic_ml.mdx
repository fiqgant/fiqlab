## Introduction

During this week, students will learn about the basic concepts of descriptive statistics and how they are used in machine learning. Students will be introduced to measures of central tendency, dispersion, and skewness, and learn techniques for calculating them. Students will also learn about probability concepts such as probability distributions, Bayes' theorem, and conditional probability, and how they are used to analyze and improve machine learning models.

This course is designed for students who are new to machine learning and want to learn the basics of descriptive statistics and probability concepts and their applications in machine learning. We will start with an overview of descriptive statistics and its concepts, and then delve into the techniques used for measures of central tendency, dispersion, and skewness. Then we will cover probability concepts such as probability distributions, Bayes' theorem, and conditional probability. We will use Python as the programming language and will be using libraries like numpy, scipy and pandas to implement the concepts and techniques covered in this course.

Throughout the course, students will have the opportunity to apply the concepts learned in class through in-class activities, homework assignments, and a final project. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the application of descriptive statistics and probability concepts in machine learning and how they can help to analyze and improve machine learning models performance.
