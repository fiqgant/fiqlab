# Introduction
React JS has become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. With its modular and efficient approach to building UI components, React JS has revolutionized the way developers build web applications. If you're a beginner who wants to learn how to build web applications using React JS, this 16-session curriculum is designed for you.

In this curriculum, you'll learn the basics of React JS, starting with an introduction to the library and its advantages over other UI libraries. You'll also learn how to install React JS and create your first project. The curriculum will cover the fundamentals of React JS, including JSX and Components, Props and Events, Lifecycle methods, and State Management.

You'll also learn how to build a simple Todo List application using React JS and apply styling to the application. The curriculum will cover advanced concepts such as Routing, API and AJAX, Middleware, and Authentication.

Additionally, you'll learn how to prepare your React JS application for deployment, and even get introduced to Next JS, a popular framework built on top of React JS.

By the end of the 16 sessions, you'll have a solid understanding of the basics of React JS and how to build web applications using the library. With a mid-term and final exam, you'll have the opportunity to test your knowledge and ensure that you're on the right track.
