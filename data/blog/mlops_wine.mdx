**What is CML?** Continuous Machine Learning (CML) is an open-source CLI tool
for implementing continuous integration & delivery (CI/CD) with a focus on
MLOps. Use it to automate development workflows ‚Äî including machine
provisioning, model training and evaluation, comparing ML experiments across
project history, and monitoring changing datasets.

CML can help train and evaluate models ‚Äî and then generate a visual report with
results and metrics ‚Äî automatically on every pull request.
