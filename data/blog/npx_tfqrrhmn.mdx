# Introduction
I was browsing GitHub the other day when I came across [Anmol Singh](https://github.com/anmol098/npx_card)'s brilliant idea of designing a npx card to identify themselves. I thought it was a great idea, so I created one for myself as well! [`npx tfqrrhmn`](https://github.com/fiqgant/npx-tfqrrhmn)
You can discover more about me right now by typing `npx tfqrrhmn` into your terminal. 

## Result

<div className="grid place-items-center">
  <img
    className="inline rounded-lg"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fiqgant/npx-tfqrrhmn/master/Images/ss.gif"
    alt="npx2"
    width="700"
    height="700"
  />
</div>

## Lets Go
Let's create a new project

```bash
mkdir npx-card
cd npx-card
npm init -y
```

Now let's install some needed NPM modules

```bash
npm i boxen chalk clear cli-spinners inquirer open ora standard
```

To make things easy, let's also include nodemon for reloading on save.

```bash
npm i nodemon --save-dev
```

Let's navigate to our scripts section in our package.json and setup nodemon

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon card.js"
  },
```

...and let's start making our own npx-card!

```bash
npm run dev
```

in our card.js file, let's import the NPM modules

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
const boxen = require("boxen");
const chalk = require("chalk");
const inquirer = require("inquirer");
const clear = require("clear");
const open = require("open");

clear()
```

Now, let's create a new prompt. We can do this using inquirer.

```javascript
const prompt = inquirer.createPromptModule();
```

Let's create a new JavaScript object with our prompt questions. This is a sample from my [`card.js`](https://github.com/fiqgant/npx-tfqrrhmn/blob/master/card.js) you can add or edit whatever you want

```javascript
const questions = [
  {
    type: "list",
    name: "action",
    message: "What you want to do?",
    choices: [
      {
        name: `Send me an ${chalk.green.bold("email")}?`,
        value: () => {
          open("mailto:fiqgant@gmail.com");
          console.log("\nDone, see you soon at inbox.\n");
        },
      },
      {
        name: `Visit my ${chalk.blue.bold("Website")}?`,
        value: () => {
          open("https://fiqlab.dev");
          console.log("\n See you at fiqlab \n");
        },
      },
      {
        name: "Just quit.",
        value: () => {
          console.log("Bye bye. Have a nice day.\n");
        },
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

Let's construct a new JavaScript object once more, but this time with information about us.
You should experiment with this for a while to get the spacing appropriate once you've properly centered the fields.
I'll just show you mine as an example.

```javascript
const data = {
  name: chalk.bold.blue("             Taufiqurrahman"),
  handle: chalk.white("@fiqgant"),
  work: `${chalk.white(" A Geek maybe?")} ${chalk
    .hex("#2b82b2")
    .bold("https://fiqlab.dev")}`,
  github: chalk.white("https://github.com/") + chalk.cyan("fiqgant"),
  linkedin: chalk.white("https://linkedin.com/in/") + chalk.cyan("fiqgant"),
  instagram: chalk.white("https://instagram.com/") + chalk.cyan("tfqrrhmn"),
  web: chalk.blue("https://fiqlab.dev"),
  npx: chalk.blue("npx") + " " + chalk.cyan("tfqrrhmn"),

  labelWork: chalk.white.bold("       Bio:"),
  labelInstagram: chalk.white.bold("  Instagram:"),
  labelGitHub: chalk.white.bold("     GitHub:"),
  labelLinkedIn: chalk.white.bold("   LinkedIn:"),
  labelProject: chalk.white.bold("    Project:"),
  labelWeb: chalk.white.bold("        Web:"),
  labelCard: chalk.white.bold("       Card:"),
};
```

Now, let's create a our card using box. We'll utilize the data from above and plug them in.

```javascript
const me = boxen(
  [
    `${data.name}`,
    "",
    `${data.labelWork}  ${data.work}`,
    "",
    `${data.labelGitHub}  ${data.github}`,
    `${data.labelLinkedIn}  ${data.linkedin}`,
    `${data.labelInstagram}  ${data.instagram}`,
    `${data.labelWeb}  ${data.web}`,
    "",
    `${data.labelCard}  ${data.npx}`,
    "",
    `${chalk.italic("I am currently looking for new opportunities,")}`,
    `${chalk.italic("my inbox is always open. Whether you have a")}`,
    `${chalk.italic("question or just want to say hi, I will try ")}`,
    `${chalk.italic("my best to get back to you!")}`,
  ].join("\n"),
  {
    margin: 1,
    float: "center",
    padding: 1,
    borderStyle: "single",
    borderColor: "cyan",
  }
);

console.log(me);
```

Here I make some tips to make people cmd/ctrl + click on the links

```javascript
const tip = [
  `Tip: Try ${chalk.cyanBright.bold("cmd/ctrl + click")} on the links above`,
  "",
].join("\n");
console.log(tip);
```

We're almost finished! Let's make sure that we handle the prompt properly.

```javascript
prompt(questions).then((answer) => answer.action());
```

Now, let's publish our card so the people can see our `npx card`

Create an account on [npmjs](https://npmjs.com/)

Make sure you're logged in to npm. If you aren't, you should do

```bash
npm adduser
```

and, patch the version

```bash
# Make sure your git working directory is clean!
git commit -m "ðŸ’³ made my npx card"

npm version patch 
```

Let's publish to [npmjs](https://npmjs.com/)!

```bash
npm publish
```

If everything is published, try running the script using npx.

```bash
# Try out mines using npx tfqrrhmn
npx yourname
```
