## Introduction

During this weeks, students will learn about the basic concepts of calculus and how they are used in machine learning. Students will be introduced to the concepts of derivatives and gradients, and learn techniques for calculating them. Students will also learn about optimization techniques such as gradient descent and Newton's method, and how they are used to improve machine learning models. Additionally, students will be introduced to the application of calculus in machine learning and learn how to use calculus to analyze and improve machine learning models.

This course is designed for students who are new to machine learning and want to learn the basics of calculus and its applications in machine learning. We will start with an overview of calculus and its concepts, and then delve into techniques used for derivatives and gradients, optimization, and its applications in machine learning. We will use Python as the programming language and will be using libraries like numpy and scipy to implement the concepts and techniques covered in this course.

Throughout the course, students will have the opportunity to apply the concepts learned in class through in-class activities, homework assignments, and a final project. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the application of calculus in machine learning and how it can help to improve model performance.
