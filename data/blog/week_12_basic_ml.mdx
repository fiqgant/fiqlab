## Introduction
In this week's study, the students will delve into the topic of unsupervised learning, specifically the algorithms of DBSCAN and Anomaly Detection. This lesson aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these algorithms and their applications in solving real-world problems. The students will learn how to identify patterns in large datasets and how to use these patterns to identify outliers and anomalies in the data.

## Objectives
- To understand the concept of unsupervised learning and how it differs from supervised learning.
- To learn about the DBSCAN algorithm, its properties and how to use it for clustering purposes.
- To understand the concept of anomaly detection and how it can be used to identify outliers in a dataset.
- To learn about various anomaly detection techniques, including statistical-based and density-based methods.
- To understand the differences between DBSCAN and anomaly detection and when to use each approach.

## Outline Lesson
