# Related Fields
Aside from AI, there are a few other related topics that are worth knowing at least by name. Machine learning, data science, and deep learning are examples of these.



## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subfield of AI, which is itself a subfield of computer science (such categories are often somewhat imprecise and some parts of machine learning could be equally well or better belong to statistics). Machine learning allows adaptive AI solutions. A brief definition can be provided as follows:



## Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is a subfield of computer science. The "depth" of deep learning refers to the complexity of a mathematical model, and that the increased computing power of modern computers has allowed researchers to increase this complexity to levels that appear not only quantitatively but also qualitatively different from before.

As you may have noticed, science frequently involves a number of increasingly specialized subfields, subfields of subfields, and so on. This allows researchers to zoom in on a certain issue, allowing them to catch up with the ever-increasing amount of knowledge accumulated through time, and develop new knowledge on the topic â€” or, in some cases, rectify older knowledge to be more accurate.



## Data Science

Data science is a relatively new umbrella term (a term that encompasses numerous subdisciplines) that incorporates machine learning and statistics, as well as certain parts of computer science such as algorithms, data storage, and web application development. Data science is also a practical subject that necessitates an understanding of the domain in which it is used, such as business or research: its objective (what "added value" entails), basic assumptions, and limits. AI is frequently used in data science solutions (but usually not as much as one would expect from the headlines).



## Robotics

Robotics is the science of designing and programming robots to perform in complicated, real-world circumstances. In some ways, robotics is the ultimate AI issue because it necessitates the integration of nearly all fields of AI. For example:

- Computer vision and speech recognition for sensing the environment
- Natural language processing, information retrieval, and reasoning under uncertainty for processing instructions and predicting consequences of potential actions
- Cognitive modeling and affective computing (systems that respond to expressions of human feelings or that mimic feelings) for interacting and working together with humans

Many of the robotics-related AI problems are best approached by machine learning, which makes machine learning a central branch of AI for robotics.
