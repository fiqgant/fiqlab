## Introduction

In this week's lesson, students will be introduced to the concept of supervised logistic regression, a widely used statistical method for classification problems in machine learning. The goal of logistic regression is to build a model that can predict the probability of an event occurring, given a set of predictor variables. Logistic regression is a type of generalized linear model that is used when the response variable is binary or categorical in nature. Students will learn about the key concepts and mathematical foundations of logistic regression, including the sigmoid function, maximum likelihood estimation, and odds ratios. In addition, students will be provided with hands-on activities that will allow them to apply their understanding of logistic regression to real-world data problems.

## Objectives

- To understand the concept of supervised logistic regression and its applications
- To be able to implement logistic regression in solving binary classification problems
- To learn how to evaluate the performance of logistic regression models
- To understand the steps involved in data preparation, model building, and evaluation for logistic regression

## Outline Lesson

### Lesson 1: Introduction to supervised logistic regression
- Definition and purpose
- Applications of logistic regression

### Lesson 2: Understanding the logistic regression model
- Sigmoid function and its properties
- Maximum likelihood estimation
- Logistic regression hypothesis function

### Lesson 3: Data preparation for logistic regression
- Importance of feature scaling
- Handling categorical variables

### Lesson 4: Model building and evaluation
- Implementation of logistic regression using Python libraries
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics

### Lesson 5: Case study - Logistic regression in real-world problems
- An example of logistic regression in healthcare

## Activities

- Students will be given a sample dataset and asked to prepare it for logistic regression.
- Students will implement logistic regression using a Python library and evaluate its performance using different evaluation metrics.
- Students will analyze the performance of logistic regression on a real-world problem and interpret the results.
- Students will be given an open-ended problem and asked to implement logistic regression to solve it.
