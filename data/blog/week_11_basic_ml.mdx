## Introduction
Unsupervised Hierarchical Clustering is a popular machine learning technique used for grouping similar data points into clusters. It is a type of clustering algorithm that groups similar data points into a hierarchy of clusters, allowing for a clear representation of the relationships between the data points.

## Objectives
- To understand the basic concept of unsupervised Hierarchical Clustering
- To understand the steps involved in performing Hierarchical Clustering
- To be able to implement Hierarchical Clustering using Python
- To analyze and interpret the results of Hierarchical Clustering on a dataset

## Outline Lesson
### Lesson 1: Overview of Unsupervised Hierarchical Clustering
- Definition of Unsupervised Hierarchical Clustering
- Advantages and disadvantages of Hierarchical Clustering
- Applications of Hierarchical Clustering

### Lesson 2: Steps involved in performing Hierarchical Clustering
- Preprocessing of the data
- Calculation of pairwise distance matrix
- Agglomerative or Divisive Clustering
- Construction of the dendrogram

### Lesson 3: Types of Linkage in Hierarchical Clustering
- Complete Linkage
- Single Linkage
- Average Linkage

### Lesson 4: Implementation of Hierarchical Clustering in Python
- Using the scikit-learn library
- Using the PyClustering library

### Lesson 5: Evaluation of Hierarchical Clustering
- Using the silhouette score
- Using the Calinski-Harabasz Index

## Activities
- Preprocess a sample dataset and perform Hierarchical Clustering using different linkage methods
- Analyze and interpret the results of Hierarchical Clustering on the sample dataset
- Compare the results of Hierarchical Clustering with other clustering algorithms such as k-means clustering
- Apply Hierarchical Clustering on a real-world dataset and present the results.
