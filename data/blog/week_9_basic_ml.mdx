## Introduction
In this week's lesson, students will be introduced to the concept of supervised Decision Trees. Decision Trees are a popular and powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The algorithm builds a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. This week's lessons will cover the basic principles of Decision Trees, the concepts of entropy, information gain, and the construction of decision trees using the ID3 algorithm.

## Objectives
- To understand the basic principles of Decision Trees
- To understand the concepts of entropy, information gain, and the construction of decision trees using the ID3 algorithm
- To learn how to implement supervised Decision Trees in real-world problems

## Outline Lesson
### Lesson 1: Introduction to Decision Trees
- Definition and background
- How Decision Trees work
- Applications of Decision Trees

### Lesson 2: Concept of Entropy
- Definition and explanation
- Calculation of entropy

### Lesson 3: Information Gain
- Definition and explanation
- Calculation of information gain

### Lesson 4: Construction of Decision Trees using ID3 Algorithm
- Steps involved in the ID3 algorithm
- Pseudo-code for ID3 algorithm

### Lesson 5: Overfitting and Pruning
- Definition and explanation
- Techniques for preventing overfitting

## Activities
- Implement Decision Trees from scratch using the ID3 algorithm on a sample dataset
- Analyze the accuracy of the Decision Tree model on a test dataset
- Use scikit-learn library to build a Decision Tree model on a real-world problem
- Visualize the Decision Tree model and interpret the results
