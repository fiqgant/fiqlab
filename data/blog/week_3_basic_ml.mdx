## Introduction

During this weeks, students will learn about the fundamental concepts of linear algebra, including matrix operations and notations, and vectors and dot product. Students will learn about matrix representations, matrix addition and subtraction, scalar multiplication, matrix-matrix multiplication, matrix-vector multiplication, inverse of a matrix, transpose of a matrix and dot product of vectors. Students will also learn about properties and examples of matrix operations and dot product and how they are used in solving real-world problems.

This course is designed for students who are new to linear algebra and want to learn the basics of matrix operations and notations and vectors and dot product. Throughout the course, students will have the opportunity to apply the concepts learned in class through in-class activities, homework assignments, and a final project. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of matrix operations and notations and vectors and dot product, and how they can be used to solve real-world problems.

## Objectives

- To provide an introduction to the basic concepts and notations of matrix operations
