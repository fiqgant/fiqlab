## Introduction

During this week, students will learn about the basic concepts of Bayes' theorem and Normal Distribution and how they are used in machine learning. Students will be introduced to the concept of conditional probability and Bayes' theorem, and learn techniques for calculating it. Students will also learn about normal distribution and its properties, and how to use it to analyze and improve machine learning models.

This course is designed for students who are new to machine learning and want to learn the basics of Bayes' theorem and normal distribution and their applications in machine learning. We will start with an overview of Bayes' theorem and its concepts, and then delve into the techniques used for calculating Bayes' theorem. Then we will cover normal distribution, its properties, standard normal distribution and z-scores. We will use Python as the programming language and will be using libraries like numpy, scipy and pandas to implement the concepts and techniques covered in this course.

Throughout the course, students will have the opportunity to apply the concepts learned in class through in-class activities, homework assignments, and a final project. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the application of Bayes' theorem and normal distribution in machine learning and how they can help to analyze and improve machine learning models performance.
