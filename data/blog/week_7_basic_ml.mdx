## Introduction

The topic of this lesson is supervised linear regression, a fundamental statistical technique that is widely used in the field of machine learning. Supervised linear regression is a method of modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. This technique is particularly useful for predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables.

The objective of this lesson is to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the basic concepts of linear regression, including simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. The students will learn how to use these techniques to make predictions, as well as how to evaluate the performance of a linear regression model.

Throughout the lesson, students will be introduced to the mathematical foundations of linear regression, including the assumptions and limitations of the technique. They will also learn how to use linear regression in practice, using sample datasets and Python programming. Additionally, students will engage in hands-on activities and exercises to practice the techniques covered in each section, such as fitting a simple linear regression model and making predictions. Furthermore, the students will be able to apply the techniques learned in the lesson to a real-world machine learning problem by means of a final project.

By the end of this lesson, students will have a solid understanding of the supervised linear regression and its applications in machine learning. They will also have the knowledge and skills necessary to use linear regression to make predictions and evaluate the performance of a linear regression model.
