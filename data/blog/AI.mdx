## How Should We Define AI?
As you may have noticed, AI is currently a "hot topic": media coverage and public debate around AI are nearly impossible to escape. However, you may have noticed that various people interpret AI differently. For some, AI refers to artificial life-forms that can outperform human intelligence; for others, AI refers to nearly any data-processing technique.

To set the stage, we'll talk about what artificial intelligence is, how it might be defined, and what other subjects or technologies are closely connected. However, before we do so, we'll showcase three AI applications that demonstrate various facets of AI. We'll return to each of them during the course to gain a better knowledge of them.



### Application 1. Self-Driving Cars

To cope with the complex and dynamic environment, self-driving cars require a variety of AI approaches, including search and planning to discover the most convenient path from A to B, computer vision to identify impediments, and decision making under ambiguity. To avoid mishaps, each of these must operate with near-perfect precision.

Other autonomous systems, such as delivery robots, flying drones, and autonomous ships, utilise similar technologies.



### Application 2. Content Recommendation

A large portion of the information we encounter on a daily basis is individualized. Examples include Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media content; online marketing; Spotify music recommendations; and Netflix, HBO, and other streaming services movie recommendations. Many online publications, including newspapers and TV firms, as well as search engines like Google, personalize the material they provide.

While the first page of the New York Times or China Daily is the same for all readers, the front page of the online edition is unique to each user. AI powers the algorithms that determine the material you see.



### Application 3. Image & Video Processing

Face recognition is already a commodity that is utilized in a variety of customer, corporate, and government applications such as arranging images by persons, automatic tagging on social media, and passport control. Similar techniques can be used to distinguish other cars and barriers in the vicinity of an autonomous vehicle, as well as to estimate wildlife numbers, to mention a few applications.

AI can also be used to create and modify visual content. Style transfer, which allows you to make your personal photos look like they were painted by Vincent van Gogh, and computer generated characters in films such as Avatar, Lord of the Rings, and popular Pixar animations, where the animated characters mimic gestures made by real human actors, are examples that are already in use today.



## What Is & Isn't Artificial Intelligence? That Is Not a Simple Question!
The popularity of AI in the media is due in part to the fact that individuals have begun to use the phrase when referring to items that were previously known by different names. You may see practically everything, from statistics and business analytics to AI, which is manually encoded if-then logic. Why is this the case? Why is the public's perception of AI so hazy? Let's take a look at a couple of them.



### Reason 1: No Officially Agreed Definition
Even AI researchers do not agree on a precise definition of AI. When some topics are categorized as non-AI and new ones emerge, the area is constantly redefined.

According to an old (geeky) joke, AI is defined as "amazing stuff that computers can't do." The irony is that, on this definition, AI can never progress: as soon as we figure out how to accomplish something great with a computer, it ceases to be an AI problem. This definition, however, contains some truth. For example, fifty years ago, automatic systems for search and planning were thought to fall under the purview of AI. Such methods are now taught to all computer science students. Similarly, many approaches for processing uncertain information are becoming so well understood that they will almost certainly be relocated from AI to statistics or probability in the near future.



### Reason 2: The Legacy of Science Fiction
The views of AI prevalent in many literary and cinematic works of science fiction add to the misunderstanding concerning the meaning of AI. Science fiction stories frequently feature nice humanoid servants that supply overly-detailed factoids or clever conversation, but they can occasionally follow Pinocchio's example and begin to question if they can become human. Another type of humanoid being in science fiction has nefarious goals and turns against their masters, similar to old legends of sorcerer's apprentices dating back to the Golem of Prague and beyond.

The robothood of such creatures is frequently merely a thin veneer on top of a highly humanlike agent, which is appropriate given that most fiction, even science fiction, must be accessible to human readers who would otherwise be alienated by intellect that is too distinct and unusual. Most science fiction is thus best interpreted as a metaphor for the current human state, with robots serving as stand-ins for oppressed elements of society or maybe our quest for the meaning of life.



### Reason 3: What Seems Easy Is Actually Hard...
Another source of difficulty in understanding AI is determining which tasks are simple and which are challenging. Consider what you did: you used your eyes to scan your surroundings, figured out where there are some suitable objects for picking up, chose one of them and planned a trajectory for your hand to reach that one, then moved your hand by contracting various muscles in sequence and managed to squeeze the object with just the right amount of force to keep it between your fingers.

It can be difficult to comprehend how complicated everything is, but it becomes clear when something goes wrong: the object you take is much heavier or lighter than you expected, or someone opens a door just as you reach for the handle, and you can find yourself badly out of balance. Normally, these types of jobs appear to be simple, but that perception belies millions of years of evolution and several years of childhood practice.

While it may be simple for you, grabbing objects by a robot is exceedingly difficult, and it is a subject of active research. [Google's robotic grabbing project](https://spectrum.ieee.org/google-large-scale-robotic-grasping-project) and a [cauliflower picking robot](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/agri-tech/automated-brassica-harvesting-in-cornwall-abc) are two recent examples.



### ...and What Seems Hard Is Actually Easy
Playing chess and doing mathematical exercises, on the other hand, appear to be extremely difficult tasks that require years of practice to perfect and involve our "higher faculties" and focussed conscious thought. It's no surprise that some early AI research focused on these kinds of tasks, which may have seemed to contain the essence of intelligence at the time.

Chess is now ideally adapted to computers, which can follow very basic rules and compute many different move sequences at a rate of billions of computations per second. In the legendary Deep Blue vs. Kasparov chess matches in 1997, computers defeated the reigning human world champion. Could you have predicted that the most difficult task would be grabbing the pieces and moving them on the board without knocking it over? In Chapter 2, we will look at the strategies utilized in games like chess and tic-tac-toe.

Similarly, while deep mathematical knowledge appears to need human intuition and ingenuity, many (but not all) tasks in a standard high school or college course may be completed using a calculator and a simple set of principles.



## So What Would Be a More Useful Definition?
A more relevant definition than the "what computers can't do yet" joke would be to enumerate characteristics of AI, in this case autonomy and adaptivity.

**Autonomy** - The ability to perform tasks in complex environments without constant guidance by a user.

**Adaptivity** - The ability to improve performance by learning from experience.



### Words Can Be Misleading
When defining and discussing AI, we must exercise caution because many of the phrases we use might be misleading. Learning, comprehension, and intelligence are common examples.

For example, you may state that a system is intelligent if it provides precise navigation instructions or detects melanoma in images of skin lesions. When we hear anything like this, we immediately assume that the system is capable of executing any work that an intelligent person is capable of performing: going to the grocery store and cooking supper, washing and folding laundry, and so on.

Similarly, when we say that a computer vision system understands images because it can segment them into distinct objects such as other cars, pedestrians, buildings, the road, and so on, the word "understand" easily implies that the system also understands that even if a person is wearing a t-shirt with a photo of a road printed on it, driving on that road is not acceptable (and over the person).

In both of the preceding scenarios, we would be incorrect.

Watch out for "suitcase words". [Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky), a cognitive scientist and one of the most important AI pioneers, invented the term **suitcase word** to describe concepts that can have several meanings even if we only intend one of them. Using such phrases raises the likelihood of misinterpretations like the one above.

It is critical to recognize that intelligence, unlike temperature, does not have a single dimension. You may compare today's temperature to yesterday's, or Helsinki's temperature to Rome's temperature, and decide which is higher and which is lower. We even believe that it is feasible to rank people based on their intelligence, which is what the intelligence quotient (IQ) is supposed to do. However, in the context of AI, it is evident that different AI systems cannot be compared in terms of intelligence on a single axis or dimension. Is a chess-playing algorithm smarter than a spam filter, or a music recommendation system smarter than a self-driving car? These inquiries make no sense. This is because artificial intelligence is narrow (we'll return to the definition of narrow AI at the end of this chapter): solving one problem teaches us nothing about solving another, distinct problem.



### Why You Can Say "a Pinch of AI" But Not "an AI"
The distinction between AI and non-AI is not a simple yes or no: while certain methods are definitely AI and others are clearly not, there are also approaches that involve a pinch of AI, much like a pinch of salt. Thus, rather than debating whether something is AI or not, it may be more appropriate to discuss its "AIness" (as in happiness or greatness).

 **AI** is not a countable noun - We would prefer to discourage the use of AI as a countable term when discussing it: one AI, two AIs, and so on. AI, like mathematics or biology, is a scientific discipline. This indicates that AI is a collection of concepts, challenges, and solutions. Because AI is a science, you should not refer to it as "an AI," just as we should not refer to biology as "a biology." This should be obvious when you say something like "we need more artificial intelligences." That just doesn't seem right, does it? (It certainly does for me.)


Despite our reservations, the use of AI as a countable term is widespread. Consider the headline [Data from wearables helped teach an AI to spot signs of diabetes](https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-07-deepheart-diabetes-cardiogram-ai.html), which is otherwise a pretty good headline because it emphasizes the importance of data while also emphasizing that the system can only detect signs of diabetes rather than making diagnoses and treatment decisions. And you should never, ever state something like [Google's artificial intelligence produced an AI that exceeds any human-made AI](https://futurism.com/google-artificial-intelligence-built-ai), which is one of the most deceptive AI headlines we've ever seen (note that the headline is not by Google Research).

The usage of AI as a countable noun isn't a significant concern if the rest of what's being stated makes sense, but if you want to sound professional, avoid using "**an AI**" and instead say "**an AI method**."
