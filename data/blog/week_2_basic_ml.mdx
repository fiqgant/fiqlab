## Introduction

In this week, students will learn about the importance of data preprocessing, understanding data and feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis in machine learning. Students will be introduced to techniques for handling missing data, outliers, feature scaling, and feature selection. Students will also learn how to explore and understand data, engineer features, and analyze data using visualization and summary statistics.

This course is designed for students who are new to machine learning and want to learn the basics of data preprocessing and analysis. We will start with an overview of machine learning and its applications, and then delve into the techniques used for data preprocessing, understanding data and feature engineering and EDA. We will use Python as the programming language and will be using libraries like pandas and numpy to preprocess and analyze the data.

Throughout the course, students will have the opportunity to apply the concepts learned in class through in-class activities, homework assignments, and a final project. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the importance of data preprocessing, understanding data and feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis in machine learning and how it can help to improve model performance.

## Objectives

- Techniques for data normalization: standardization, normalization, and min-max scaling

### Lesson 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Overview of the importance of EDA in machine learning
- Techniques for visualizing data: histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps
- Techniques for calculating summary statistics: mean, median, mode, and standard deviation
- Techniques for identifying patterns and trends in data: correlation and covariance
- Techniques for identifying outliers and anomalies in data: z-score and IQR

## Activities

- In-class activities and hands-on exercises to practice the techniques covered in each lesson
- Homework assignments to apply the techniques to real-world datasets
- A final project where students will apply all the techniques learned in the module to a real-world dataset
