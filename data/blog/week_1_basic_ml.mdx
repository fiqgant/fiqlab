# Introduction
In this week, students will be introduced to the basic concepts and terminology of machine learning. They will learn about the definition of machine learning and its importance, as well as the different types of machine learning such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Students will also be familiarized with common machine learning applications in different industries. Additionally, students will be introduced to basic programming concepts in Python such as data types, variables, control flow statements, functions, and modules. This week's lessons and activities will lay the foundation for students to understand the key concepts and terminology used in machine learning and to develop a basic understanding of programming in Python.
