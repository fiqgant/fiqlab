# **Introduction**

In this week, students will be introduced to the basic concepts and terminology of machine learning. They will learn about the definition of machine learning and its importance, as well as the different types of machine learning such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Students will also be familiarized with common machine learning applications in different industries. Additionally, students will be introduced to basic programming concepts in Python such as data types, variables, control flow statements, functions, and modules. This week's lessons and activities will lay the foundation for students to understand the key concepts and terminology used in machine learning and to develop a basic understanding of programming in Python.

# Week 1 - Introduction to Machine Learning
# Basic data types and variables
``` python
# Basic data types
integer_var = 5
float_var = 3.14
string_var = "fiq"
bool_var = True

# Variable reassignment
integer_var = 7

# Basic mathematical operations
sum = integer_var + float_var
difference = integer_var - float_var
product = integer_var * float_var
quotient = integer_var / float_var

print(integer_var)
print(float_var)
print(string_var)
print(bool_var)
print('--------------------')
print(sum)
print(difference)
print(product)
print(quotient)

## Here\'s an example of control flow statements using if-else:
``` python
age = 18
if age < 21:
    print("You are not old enough to drink.")
else:
    print("You are old enough to drink.")
```

# Group by gender and calculate the mean age
print(df.groupby('gender').mean())

# Data visualization
# Bar chart of the count of each gender
df['gender'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')
