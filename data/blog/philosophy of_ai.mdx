# Philosophy of AI?
The term "artificial intelligence" raises philosophical problems about whether intelligent activity implies or necessitates the existence of a mind, and to what extent awareness may be replicated as computation.



## The Turing test

[Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) was an English mathematician and logician who lived from 1912 until 1954. He is justifiably regarded as the "Father of Computer Science." Turing was attracted by intelligence and reasoning, as well as the potential of machines replicating them. Turing's most notable contribution to AI is his imitation game, which became known as the [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) later on.

A human interrogator engages with two players, A and B, in the test by exchanging textual letters (in a chat). If the interrogator is unable to tell whether player A or B is a computer or a person, the computer is considered to have passed the test. The theory goes that if a computer can be distinguished from a human in a general natural language conversation, it has attained human-level intelligence.

Turing's interpretation of the test is comparable to Forrest Gump's aphorism: "Stupid is as stupid does." "Intelligent is as intelligent says," Turing would say. In other words, an entity is intelligent if its behavior cannot be distinguished from that of another intelligent creature. Turing simply restricted the collection of behaviors under consideration so that the interrogator could not base his or her conclusion on looks.
