# Philosophy of AI
The term "artificial intelligence" raises philosophical problems about whether intelligent activity implies or necessitates the existence of a mind, and to what extent awareness may be replicated as computation.



## The Turing test

[Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) was an English mathematician and logician who lived from 1912 until 1954. He is justifiably regarded as the "Father of Computer Science." Turing was attracted by intelligence and reasoning, as well as the potential of machines replicating them. Turing's most notable contribution to AI is his imitation game, which became known as the [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) later on.

A human interrogator engages with two players, A and B, in the test by exchanging textual letters (in a chat). If the interrogator is unable to tell whether player A or B is a computer or a person, the computer is considered to have passed the test. The theory goes that if a computer can be distinguished from a human in a general natural language conversation, it has attained human-level intelligence.

Turing's interpretation of the test is comparable to Forrest Gump's aphorism: "Stupid is as stupid does." "Intelligent is as intelligent says," Turing would say. In other words, an entity is intelligent if its behavior cannot be distinguished from that of another intelligent creature. Turing simply restricted the collection of behaviors under consideration so that the interrogator could not base his or her conclusion on looks.



### One Problem: Does Being Human-like Mean You Are Intelligent?
One critique of the Turing test as a test for intelligence is that it may be more concerned with whether the computer behaves like a human than with whether it is intelligent. The test has been "passed" by computer programs that constantly change the subject, make numerous spelling mistakes, and sometimes fail to respond at all. [Eugene Goostman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Goostman), a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy, is a renowned example of how to avoid answering questions by making jokes and changing the subject to his pet guinea pig. Here is a short excerpt from [Scott Aaronson's blog](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1858) of an example chat with Eugene Goostman:



#### Is Eugene a computer or a person?

üßë‚Äçüî¨ **Interrogator**: How many legs does a camel have?

ü§ñ **Eugene**: Something between 2 and 4. Maybe, three? :-))) By the way, I still don‚Äôt know your specialty - or, possibly, I‚Äôve missed it?

üßë‚Äçüî¨ **Interrogator**: How many legs does a millipede have?

ü§ñ **Eugene**: Just two, but Chernobyl mutants may have them up to five. I know you are supposed to trick me.

üßë‚Äçüî¨ **Interrogator**: No, I need to know that you‚Äôre not a chatbot. Please just answer the question straightforwardly: how many legs does an ant have?

ü§ñ **Eugene**: Something between 2 and 4. Maybe, three? :-))) Oh, what a fruitful conversation;-)

üßë‚Äçüî¨ **Interrogator**: Do you understand why I‚Äôm asking such basic questions? Do you realize I‚Äôm just trying to unmask you as a robot as quickly as possible, like in the movie ‚ÄúBlade Runner‚Äù?

ü§ñ **Eugene**: ...wait

## The Chinese Room Argument

Some have questioned the notion that intellect is synonymous with intelligent behavior. John Searle's [Chinese Room](https://iep.utm.edu/chinese-room-argument/) thought experiment is the most well-known counter-argument. Searle outlines an experiment in which a non-Chinese speaker is locked in a room. A person standing outside the room can sneak notes written in Chinese into the room through a postal slot. The individual inside the chamber is given a large guidebook with precise instructions for responding to notes from the outside.

Searle contended that, even if the person outside the room believes he is conversing with another Chinese speaker, the person inside the room does not understand Chinese. Similarly, even if a computer behaves intelligently, for example, by passing the Turing test, this does not imply that it is intelligent or that it has a "mind" in the same sense that a human does. A similar argument can be made if the word "intelligent" is replaced by the word "aware."



### Is a Self-driving Car Intelligent?

The Chinese Room argument contradicts the idea that intelligence may be reduced to simple mechanical instructions that can be automated.

A self-driving car is an example of an automated intelligence element (driving a car). However, the Chinese Room argument implies that this isn't actually sophisticated thinking: it only appears to be. Returning to the earlier idea of "suitcase words," the AI system in the automobile does not see or understand its surroundings, and it does not know how to drive safely in the same manner that a person sees, understands, and knows. According to Searle, this means that the system's intelligent behavior is essentially different from its true intelligence.



## How Much Does Philosophy Matter in Practice?
The definitions of intelligence, whether natural or artificial, and awareness appear to be exceedingly slippery, leading to seemingly endless debate. This topic can be rather fun in intelligent company (in the absence of proper company, works such as The Mind's I by Hofstadter and Dennett can provide excitement).

However, as [John McCarthy](http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/aiphil/aiphil.pdf) pointed out, AI philosophy is "unlikely to have any more effect on AI research practice than philosophy of science generally does on science practice." As a result, we'll keep looking into systems that can help us solve real problems without worrying too much about whether or not they're clever.



## General vs Narrow AI
<div className="grid place-items-center">

You may come across the terms "general" and "narrow" AI while reading the news. So, what does this all mean? Narrow AI is AI that only handles one task. A machine that can handle any intellectual task is referred to as general AI, or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). All of the AI methods we use now are classified as narrow AI, while general AI is considered science fiction. Indeed, the goal of AGI has been all but abandoned by AI researchers due to a lack of development in more than 50 years despite all efforts. In contrast, narrow AI advances at a breakneck pace.



## Strong vs Weak AI

</div>
Another distinction is between "strong" and "weak" AI. This boils down to Searle's emphasis on the philosophical gap between being clever and acting wisely. Strong AI would imply a "mind" that is both intelligent and self-conscious. We actually have weak AI, which is systems that display intelligent behaviors despite being "mere" computers.
