When we use `setState()` Flutter calls the build method and rebuilds every widget tree inside it. The best way to avoid this is by using const costructors.

**Use const constructors whenever possible** when building your own widgets or using Flutter widgets. This helps Flutter to rebuild only widgets that should be updated.

So if you have a `StatefulWidget` and you are using `setState((){})` to update that widget and you have widgets like:

```dart:main.dart
class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> {

  String title = "Title";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(title),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: <Widget>[
          const Text("Text 1"),
          const Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
            child: const Text("Another Text widget"),
          ),
          const Text("Text 3"),
        ],
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
        onPressed: () {
          setState(() => title = 'New Title');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

If you run this code and press the floating action button, all the widgets defined as const won't get rebuilded.
