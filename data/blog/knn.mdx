# Introduction
Assume we are given a dataset where  $X$  is a matrix of features from an observation and  $Y$  is a class label. We will use this notation throughout this article.  $k$ -nearest neighbors then, is a method of classification that estimates the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$ and classifies an observation to the class with the highest probability. Given a positive integer $k$, $k$-nearest neighbors looks at the $k$ observations closest to a test observation  $x_0$  and estimates the conditional probability that it belongs to class $j$ using the formula
