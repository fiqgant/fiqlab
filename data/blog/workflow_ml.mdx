summary: The general idea of machine learning is to get a model to learn trends from historical data on any topic and be able to reproduce those trends on comparable data in the future.

The general goal of machine learning is to train a model to recognize patterns in any type of historical data so that it can repeat those patterns on similar data in the future. Hereâ€™s a diagram outlining the basic machine learning process :

# Introduction
In this blog, we will go through the workflow of a machine learning project, which includes all of the stages necessary to develop a professional machine learning project from the ground up.

```

## Understanding the machine learning workflow
- Gathering data
- Data pre-processing
- Researching the model that will be best for the type of data
- Training and testing the model
- Evaluation
