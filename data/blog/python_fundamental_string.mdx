You‚Äôll learn about Python string and its basic operations.

## Introduction to Python string
A string is a series of characters. In Python, anything inside quotes is a string. And you can use either single or double quotes. For example:

```python
message = 'This is a string in Python'
message = "This is also a string"
```

If a string contains a single quote, you should place it in double-quotes like this:

```python
message = "It's a string"
```

And when a string contains double quotes, you can use the single quotes:

```python
message = '"Beautiful is better than ugly.". Said Tim Peters'
```

To escape the quotes, you use the backslash (`\`). For example:

```python
message = 'It\'s also a valid string'
```

The Python interpreter will treat the backslash character (`\`) special. If you don‚Äôt want it to do so, you can use raw strings by adding the letter `r` before the first quote. For example:

```python
message = r'C:\python\bin'
```

## Creating multiline strings
To span a string multiple lines, you use triple-quotes ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù or ‚Äù‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äù‚Äô. For example:

```python
help_message = '''
Usage: mysql command
    -h hostname     
    -d database name
    -u username
    -p password 
'''

print(help_message)
```

It‚Äôll output the following if you execute the program:

```powershell
Usage: mysql command
    -h hostname
    -d database name
    -u username
    -p password
```

## Using variables in Python strings with the f-strings

Sometimes, you want to use the values of variables in a string.

For example, you may want to use the value of the `name` variable inside the `message` string variable:

```python
name = 'Fiq'
message = 'Hi'
```

To do it, you place the letter `f` before the opening quotation mark and put the brace around the variable name:

```python
name = 'Fiq'
message = f'Hi {name}'
print(message)
```

Python will replace the `{name}` by the value of the `name` variable. The code will show the following on the screen:

```powershell
Hi Fiq
```

The `message` is a format string, or f-string in short. Python introduced the f-string in version 3.6.

## Concatenating Python strings
When you place the string literals next to each other, Python automatically concatenates them into one string. For example:

```python
greeting = 'Good ' 'Morning!'
print(greeting)
```

Output:

```powershell
Good Morning!
```

To concatenate two string variables, you use the operator `+`:

```python
greeting = 'Good '
time = 'Afternoon'

greeting = greeting + time + '!'
print(greeting)
```
Output:

```powershell
Good Afternoon!
```

## Accessing string elements
Since a string is a sequence of characters, you can access its elements using an index. The first character in the string has an index of zero.

The following example shows how to access elements using an index:

```python
str = "Python String"
print(str[0]) # P
print(str[1]) # y
```

How it works:
- First, create a variable that holds a string `"Python String"`.
- Then, access the first and second characters of the string by using the square brackets `[]` and indexes.

If you use a negative index, Python returns the character starting from the end of the string. For example:

```python
str = "Python String"
print(str[-1])  # g
print(str[-2])  # n
```

The following illustrates the indexes of the string `"Python String"`:

```python
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| P | y | t | h | o | n |   | S | t | r | i | n | g | 
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11  12
-13  -12  -11  -10 -9  -8  -7  -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1 
```

### Getting the length of a string

To get the length of a string, you use the `len()` function. For example:

```python
str = "Python String"
str_len = len(str)
print(str_len)
```

Output:

```powershell
13
```

## Slicing strings
Slicing allows you to get a substring from a string. For example:

```python
str = "Python String"
print(str[0:2])
```

Output:

```powershell
Py
```

The `str[0:2]` returns a substring that includes the character from the index 0 (included) to 2 (excluded).

The syntax for slicing is as follows:

```python
string[start:end]
```

The substring always includes the character at the `start` and excludes the string at the `end`.

The `start` and `end` are optional. If you omit the `start`, it defaults to zero. If you omit the `end`, it defaults to the string‚Äôs length.

## Python strings are immutable
Python strings are immutable. It means that you cannot change the string. For example, you‚Äôll get an error if you update one or more characters in a string:

```python
str = "Python String"
str[0] = 'J'
```

error

```powershell
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "app.py", line 2, in <module>
    str[0] = 'J'
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment</module>
```

When want to modify a string, you need to create a new one from the existing string. For example:

```python
str = "Python String"
new_str = 'J' + str[1:]
print(new_str)
```

Output:

```powershell
Python String
```

## Summary
- In Python, a string is a series of characters. Also, Python strings are immutable.
- Use quotes, either single-quotes or double-quotes to create string literals.
- Use the backslash character \ to escape quotes in strings
- Use raw strings r'...' to escape the backslash character.
- Use f-strings to insert substitute variables in literal strings.
- Place literal strings next to each other to concatenate them. And use the + operator to concatenate string variables.
- Use the len() function to get the size of a string.
- Use the str[n] to access the character at the position n of the string str.
- Use slicing to extract a substring from a string.
