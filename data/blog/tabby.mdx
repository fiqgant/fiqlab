# ðŸš€ Tabby - A terminal for a more modern age

[Tabby](https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby) (formerly Terminus) is a highly configurable terminal emulator, SSH and serial client for Windows, macOS and Linux

For the past few days I've been using [Euginy's](https://github.com/Eugeny/) terminal, [Tabby](https://tabby.sh/).

There are many advantages in this tabby and I have listed some of the advantages of tabby that I took from their [Github](https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby) and [Website](https://tabby.sh/).

## Things you can do with Tabby
### General
- Text editing: In most shells and editors, you can use `Ctrl-Arrows` (`âŒ¥-Arrows`) and `Home`/`End` (`âŒ˜-Left`/`âŒ˜-Right`) to move the cursor around in the prompt. missing in the main font only.
- Intelligent Ctrl-C: When text is selected, Ctrl-C will copy it on the first press, and issue an actual abort on the second press. You can disable this by unassigning the Intelligent Ctrl-C hotkey.
- Quake mode / docking: you can make the main terminal window show up / hide with a hotkey and have it stick to the top part of screen by enabling docking in Settings -> Window.
- Fallback fonts: Your favourite font has no icons or Powerline symbols? You can set a Powerline-enabled font as the fallback font in `Settings -> Appearance` and Tabby will use it for the symbols

### Split panes
- Type into all panes at once (also known as "broadcast"): You can type into all panes by pressing `Ctrl-Shift-I` (`âŒ˜-Shift-i`). Click any pane to cancel focus.
- Pane rearrange hotkey: hold `Ctrl-Shift` (`âŒ˜-Shift`) and pane drag handles will appear. You can rearrange panes or drag them out as new tabs:

</div>

- Maximizing panes: `Ctrl-Alt-Enter` (`âŒ˜-âŒ¥-Enter`) to make the current pane temporarily full-size, press again to cancel.
- Keyboard navigation around panes: you can navigate around the splits with `Ctrl-Alt-Arrows` (`âŒ˜-âŒ¥-Arrows`)
- Saving pane layouts: with multiple panes present, right-click a tab and select Save layout as profile. You can even combine different pane types (local/SSH/serial) by opening multiple tabs first and then dragging them one into another to combine, or by using the Switch pane profile context menu item or shortcut.
- Exploding and combining tabs: `Ctrl-Shift-.` (`âŒ˜-Shift-.`) to turn all split panes in the current tab into their own tabs / `Ctrl-Shift-`, (`âŒ˜-Shift-,`) to combine all tabs back into the current one as panes. Combine this with broadcast (`Ctrl-Shift-i` / `âŒ˜-Shift-i`) to quickly send commands to all tabs! 1.0.173+

### Networking
- Debugging socket servers: you can use the `Raw socket connectio`n` profile template to debug various servers, `nc` style. Combine with `Hexadecimal` input and output modes in the profile settings to work with binary protocols:

- SOCKS proxy support for SSH: You can connect to an SSH host via a proxy without having to set up a ProxyCommand:

</div>

### Profiles
- Changing defaults for all profiles: You can edit the profile defaults for each profile type (local/SSH/serial) in `Settings -> Profiles -> Advanced`.
- Separate profile selectors: you can assign a hotkey to show a profile selector just for SSH profiles / serial profiles etc - see the `profile-selectors.*` hotkeys (not assigned by default).

### Other
- Docker: there is an official Docker plugin that lets you spawn shells inside new or existing containers.
- Working with buggy serial adapters: the `Slow feed` option in the profile's advanced settings will slow down output to the serial driver by sending content byte by byte.
- Activity notification: select `Notify on activity` in a tab's context menu to get a notification when there's new output.
- Process completion notification: select `Notify when done` in a tab's context menu to get a notification when a child process completes in the tab (only works for local shells):
