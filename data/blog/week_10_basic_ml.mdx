## Introduction
This week, students will be introduced to unsupervised learning and the k-means algorithm in particular. Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that involves training models on unlabeled data, with the goal of discovering patterns or relationships in the data. The k-means algorithm is a popular unsupervised learning technique that is used for clustering data points into distinct groups based on their similarity.

## Objectives
- To understand the concept of unsupervised learning and the k-means algorithm
- To learn how to implement the k-means algorithm in Python
- To gain experience working with unsupervised learning techniques and exploring the results

## Outline Lesson
### Lesson 1: Overview of unsupervised learning
- Definition of unsupervised learning
- Comparison with supervised learning
- Applications of unsupervised learning

### Lesson 2: The k-means algorithm
- How the k-means algorithm works
- Steps in implementing the k-means algorithm
- Assessing the quality of k-means clustering

### Lesson 3: Implementing k-means in Python
- Loading a sample dataset
- Fitting the k-means model
- Visualizing the results

### Lesson 4: Working with k-means clustering results
- Understanding the cluster labels
- Interpreting the centroids
- Assessing the quality of the clustering results

## Activities
- Students will work through a series of tutorials and exercises to gain hands-on experience with the k-means algorithm in Python.
- Students will analyze and interpret the results of k-means clustering on sample datasets, exploring different aspects of the algorithm and the resulting clusters.
- Students will work on a project that involves using k-means clustering to analyze a real-world dataset, and presenting their findings to the class.
