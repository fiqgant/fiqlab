You‚Äôll learn about Python variables and how to use them effectively.

## What is a variable in Python
A lot of values need to be managed when developing a program. You utilize variables to store values.

A variable in Python is a label that you may provide a value to. Additionally, a variable is always linked to a value. For instance:

```python
message = 'Hello, World!'
print(message)

message = 'Good Bye!'
print(message)
```

Output

```powershell
Hello, World!
Good Bye!
```

The word `message` is a variable in this instance. It is strung with the phrase "Hello, World!" The text Hello, World! is displayed on the screen by the print() function.

The message variable is given the string "Goodbye!" in the next line, and its value is displayed on the screen.

At different periods, the variable message may contain a range of values. And over the course of the program, its worth can vary.
