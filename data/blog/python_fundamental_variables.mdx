You‚Äôll learn about Python variables and how to use them effectively.

## What is a variable in Python
A lot of values need to be managed when developing a program. You utilize variables to store values.

A variable in Python is a label that you may provide a value to. Additionally, a variable is always linked to a value. For instance:

```python
message = 'Hello, World!'
print(message)

message = 'Good Bye!'
print(message)
```

Output

```bash
Hello, World!
Good Bye!
```

The word `message` is a variable in this instance. It is strung with the phrase `'Hello, World!'` The text `Hello, World!` is displayed on the screen by the `print()` function.

The message variable is given the string "Goodbye!" in the next line, and its value is displayed on the screen.

At different periods, the variable `message` may contain a range of values. And over the course of the program, its worth can vary.

## Creating variables
To define a variable, you use the following syntax:

```python
variable_name = value
```
The assignment operator is `=`. You give the `variable_name` a value using this syntax.

The value you provide the variable can be anything, including an integer, a string, etc.

The following establishes a variable called `counter` and gives it the value 1:

```python
counter = 1
```

## Naming variables
There are various guidelines you must follow when naming a variable. You will encounter an error if you don't.

The variable laws that you need to remember are as follows:
- All that is permitted in variable names are characters, numbers, and underscores (`_`). Instead of a number, they may begin with a letter or an underscore (`_`).
- Spaces are not permitted in variable names. You use underscores, like `sorted_list`, to divide words in variables.
- In Python, keywords, reserved terms, and built-in functions cannot be used as variable names.

You can define good variable names using the following recommendations:
- Variable names ought to be clear and illustrative. The `active_user` variable, for instance, provides more information than `au`.
- To separate numerous words in the variable names, use underscores (`_`).
- Because they resemble the numbers `1` and `0`, the letter `l` and the uppercase letter `O` should not be used.

## Summary 
- A variable is a name to which you can give a value. During the course of the program, a variable's value could change.
- To create a variable, use the formula `variable_name = value`.
- It is best if the variable names are brief and descriptive. They should also follow the guidelines for naming variables in Python.
