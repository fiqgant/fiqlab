## Introduction to type conversion in Python

To get an input from users, you use the `input()` function. For example:

```python
value = input('Enter a value:')
print(value)
```

When you execute this code, it‚Äôll prompt you for an input on the Terminal:

```bash
Enter a value:
```

If you enter a value, for example, a number, the program will display that value back:

```bash
Enter a value:100
100
```

However, the `input()` function returns a string, not an integer.

The following example prompts you for entering two input values: net price and tax rate. After that, it calculates the net price and displays the result on the screen:

```python
price = input('Enter the price ($):')
tax = input('Enter the tax rate (%):')

net_price = price * tax / 100

print(f'The net price is ${net_price}')
```

When you execute the program and enter some numbers:

```bash
Enter the price ($):100
Enter the tax rate (%):10
```

‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll get the following error:

```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "app.py", line 4, in <module>
    net_price = price * tax / 100
TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'
```

Since the input values are strings, you cannot apply the arithmetic operator (`+`) to them.

To solve this issue, you need to convert the strings to numbers before performing calculations.

To convert a string to a number, you use the `int()` function. More precisely, the `int()` function converts a string to an integer.

The following example uses the `int()` function to convert the input strings to numbers:

```python
price = input('Enter the price ($):')
tax = input('Enter the tax rate (%):')

net_price = int(price) * int(tax) / 100
print(f'The net price is ${net_price}')
```

If you run the program, enter some values, you‚Äôll see that it works correctly:

```bash
Enter the price ($):100
Enter the tax rate (%):10
The net price is $ 10.0
```

## Other type conversion functions

Besides the `int(str)` functions, Python support other type conversion functions. The following shows the most important ones for now:

- `float(str)` ‚Äì convert a string to a floating-point number.
- `bool(val)` ‚Äì convert a value to a boolean value, either True or False.
- `str(val)` ‚Äì return the string representation of a value.

### Getting the type of a value

To get the type of a value, you use the `type(value)` function. For example:

```bash
>>> type(100)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(2.0)
<class 'float'>
>>> type('Hello')
<class 'str'>
>>> type(True)
<class 'bool'>
```

As you can see clearly from the output:

- The number `100` has the type of `int`.
- The number `2.0` has the type of `float`.
- The string `'Hello'` has the type of `str`.
- And the `True` value has the type of `bool`.
In front of each type, you see the `class` keyword. It isn‚Äôt important for now. And you‚Äôll learn more about the class later.

## Summary
Use the `input()` function to get an input string from users.
Use type conversion functions such as `int()`, `float()`, `bool()`, and `str(vaue)` to convert a value from one type to another.
Use the `type()` function to get the type of a value.
