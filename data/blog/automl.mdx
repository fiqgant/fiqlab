# What is AutoML?

Automated machine learning (AutoML) is a field that aims to automate the process of building and tuning machine learning models. It is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to search through a range of model types and hyperparameters, selecting the best model for a given dataset.

AutoML can be used for a variety of tasks, including classification, regression, and natural language processing. It can be applied to a wide range of industries and contexts, making it a versatile tool for data scientists and machine learning practitioners.

# Why Use AutoML?

There are several reasons why you might want to use AutoML:

1. It saves time and effort: Building and tuning machine learning models can be time-consuming and requires a lot of trial and error. With AutoML, you can automate this process, saving you a lot of time and effort. Instead of manually selecting a model type and hyperparameters, the AutoML tool will automatically search through a range of options and find the best model for your data.

2. It democratizes machine learning: One of the barriers to using machine learning has been the need for expertise in the field. With AutoML, you can build machine learning models without needing to be a machine learning expert. This democratizes the field, making it more accessible to a wider range of people. This can be particularly useful for small businesses or organizations that don't have the resources to hire a machine learning expert.

3. It allows you to focus on the business problem: When you use AutoML, you can focus on the business problem you are trying to solve, rather than getting bogged down in the technical details of building and tuning a machine learning model. This allows you to be more creative and strategic in your approach, and helps you to see the bigger picture.

4. It has a wide range of applications: AutoML can be used for a variety of tasks including classification, regression, and natural language processing. This means you can apply your skills in a wide range of industries and contexts. For example, you might use AutoML to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry, or to classify customer reviews as positive or negative in the retail industry.

5. It has a bright future: The demand for machine learning experts is only expected to grow in the coming years, and AutoML is a rapidly growing field within machine learning. Studying AutoML can open up a range of career opportunities in the future.

# How Does AutoML Work?

AutoML works by automating the process of building and tuning machine learning models. It does this by using algorithms to search through a range of model types and hyperparameters, selecting the best model for a given dataset.

The exact process for building and tuning a machine learning model with AutoML will depend on the specific tool or library you are using. However, the general steps are as follows:

1. Preprocess the data: The first step is to preprocess the data, which may include cleaning, imputing missing values, and scaling.

2. Split the data: The next step is to split the data into training and testing sets. This is typically done using a 80/20 or 70/30 split, with the larger portion being used for training and the smaller portion being used for testing.

3. Train the model: The AutoML tool will then build and tune a machine learning model using the training data. This typically involves evaluating a range of model types and hyperparameters, and selecting

4. Evaluate the model: Once the model has been trained, it is evaluated using the testing data to see how well it performs.

5. Select the best model: The AutoML tool will then select the best model based on its performance on the testing data.

6. Make predictions: The final step is to use the selected model to make predictions on new data.

# Which Tools and Libraries Offer AutoML?

There are several tools and libraries available for using AutoML, including:

1. H2O.ai: H2O.ai is a popular open-source AutoML library that offers a powerful and easy-to-use interface. It is available in Python, R, and Scala.

2. Google Cloud AutoML: Google Cloud AutoML is a cloud-based AutoML platform that allows you to build and deploy machine learning models quickly and easily. It offers a range of pre-trained models, as well as the option to build custom models using AutoML.

3. DataRobot: DataRobot is a commercial AutoML platform that offers a range of tools and features for building and deploying machine learning models. It is available in Python, R, and a web interface.

4. Auto-Sklearn: Auto-Sklearn is an open-source AutoML library that is built on top of the popular scikit-learn library in Python. It offers a range of model types and hyperparameter optimization options.

5. TPOT: TPOT is an open-source AutoML library for Python that uses genetic programming to search for the best machine learning pipeline for a given dataset. It is particularly useful for optimizing hyperparameters.
