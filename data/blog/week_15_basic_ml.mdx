## Introduction
The focus of this week will be on hands-on application of the various techniques and tools learned throughout the course. The objective of this week is to provide students with practical experience in designing and implementing a small project that showcases their understanding of the concepts and methods studied so far. The project work will be an opportunity for students to demonstrate their ability to apply the theories and techniques covered in class to real-world problems. Through the process of project work, students will develop skills in problem-solving, data analysis, and modeling, as well as experience in working with various machine learning libraries and frameworks such as Python, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn.

## Objectives
