# What is TinyML?

TinyML is a field that focuses on developing and deploying machine learning models on extremely low-power devices. It has the potential to revolutionize the Internet of Things (IoT) by enabling a vast array of devices to perform complex tasks using minimal computing resources.

One of the key challenges in TinyML is finding ways to reduce the size and computational complexity of machine learning models, so they can run efficiently on devices with limited memory and processing power. To address this challenge, researchers are exploring techniques such as model compression, pruning, and quantization.

But TinyML is not just about making machine learning models smaller and more efficient. It is also about finding ways to efficiently collect and process data on low-power devices. This is critical for the IoT, as many devices are battery-powered and have limited resources for data storage and processing. To solve this problem, researchers are exploring techniques such as federated learning and edge computing.

## Current Applications of TinyML
