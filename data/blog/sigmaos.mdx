SigmaOS is a modern browser designed specifically for work, aimed at making you faster and better. It offers features like organizing your work in one window with multiple workspaces, vertically-arranged tabs that you can easily group, rename, lock, snooze, or mark as done, and much more. In this article, I'll be sharing my two week experience using SigmaOS and what I think about it.

## Getting Started with SigmaOS

The first thing that impressed me about SigmaOS was how easy it was to switch from my previous browser. In just a few simple steps, I was able to bring over all my passwords, bookmarks, favorites, history, and extensions, all with just one click.

### The Lazy Search üîç

One of my favorite features in SigmaOS is the Lazy Search. This single tool searches through tabs, searches, commands, bookmarks, and more, making it super easy to find what I'm looking for. No more digging through multiple windows and tabs!

### Split Screen ‚úÇÔ∏è

Another feature I found very useful was Split Screen. This allows me to view two tabs at once, making multitasking a breeze. I no longer have to switch back and forth between multiple browser windows.

I can easily drag and drop images, keep an eye on my social media accounts, control my music, and more, all without having to switch to a different app.

### Cloud Sync ‚òÅÔ∏è

SigmaOS also offers cloud sync, allowing me to pick up my work from anywhere and have my workspaces and pages synced across my devices. This is a huge plus for someone like me who uses multiple devices throughout the day.

## Additional Features

SigmaOS also comes with some other great features, like:

- Apple Keychain: Like Safari, SigmaOS uses Apple Keychain to protect your passwords and lock them behind biometrics (when available).
- Chrome Extensions: Like Chrome, SigmaOS works with the most popular Chromium Extensions, allowing you to easily power-up your workflows.
- Separate Cookies: This allows you to login to different accounts within a single workspace, making it easy to switch between your personal and company accounts.
- Ad Blocker: Say goodbye to ads on the internet with SigmaOS's built-in ad blocker.
- Power-Efficient: SigmaOS is built natively for macOS and optimized for M1/M2, making it power-efficient and perfect for maximizing your battery life.
- Shortcuts: SigmaOS's shortcuts are super powerful and easy to learn, allowing you to quickly search, snooze tabs, tag pages, manage your to-dos, send pages to colleagues and friends, and more.
- Education Deal: If you're affiliated with an educational institution, you can get free access to SigmaOS Pro.
- Startup Deal: Startups can get $1000 off SigmaOS Pro to help reach peak productivity.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, I was very impressed with my two week experience using SigmaOS.
