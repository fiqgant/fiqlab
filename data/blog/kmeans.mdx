# Introduction

K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm used in unsupervised machine learning that groups similar data points into clusters and finds the center of each cluster. 

## How K-Means Works

K-Means follows these four straightforward steps:

1. Initialization: Pick $K$ initial centers randomly. For example, if $K=2$, the centers could be at $(2, 4)$ and $(5, 6)$.

2. Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest center.

3. Recalculation: Calculate the average of the assigned data points and set the new centers.

4. Repeat: Repeat steps `2` and `3` until the centers don't change or until a maximum number of attempts is reached.

Consider a sample set of $5$ data points: $(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 5), (5, 7), (6, 8)$.

### Step 1: Initialization

Start with two centers at $(2, 4)$ and $(5, 6)$.

### Step 2: Assignment

Assign each data point to the nearest center:
$$
(1, 2) is closest to (2, 4)
$$

$$
(2, 4) is closest to (2, 4)
$$

$$
(3, 5) is closest to (2, 4)
$$

$$
(5, 7) is closest to (5, 6)
$$

$$
(6, 8) is closest to (5, 6)
$$

So, our data points are divided into two clusters:

- Cluster 1: 
$$
(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 5) -> center (2, 4)
$$

- Cluster 2: 
$$
(5, 7), (6, 8) -> center (5, 6)
$$

### Step 3: Recalculation

Calculate the average of the assigned data points and set the new centers:


$(2, 4)$ = average of 
$$
[(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 5)] = (2, 4)
$$


$(5.5, 7.5)$ = average of 
$$
[(5, 7), (6, 8)] = (5.5, 7.5)
$$

So, our new centers are $(2, 4)$ and $(5.5, 7.5)$.

### Step 4: Repeat

Repeat steps `2` and `3` until the centers don't change or until the maximum number of attempts is reached.

In this example, after one more iteration, the centers won't change and the algorithm will converge. The final outcome is that our data points are divided into two clusters:

- Cluster 1: 
$$
(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 5) -> center (2, 4)
$$

- Cluster 2: 
$$
(5, 7), (6, 8) -> center (5.5, 7.5)
$$

And the `sum` of the squared distances from each data point to its assigned cluster center is minimized.

## The Bottom Line

K-Means is a simple and effective way of clustering and grouping data points into distinct categories. By following the four steps of initialization, assignment, recalculation, and repeat, K-Means can easily be applied to solve various real-world problems.
