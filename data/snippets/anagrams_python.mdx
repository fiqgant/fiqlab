This method can be used to check if two strings are anagrams. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
``` Python showLineNumbers
from collections import Counter

def anagram(first, second):
    return Counter(first) == Counter(second)

anagram("abcd1233", "123acdb") # True
```
