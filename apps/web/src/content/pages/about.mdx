## WHO AM I

I have a deep passion for programming, both as a hobby and for small side projects. Since beginning my programming journey in 2016 with Delphi 7, I have explored various programming languages including C, C++, C#, Java, PHP, MySQL, and Kotlin. 

Ultimately, I found my true interest lies in Python. In addition to programming, I have a strong interest in visual IT disciplines such as 3D design, motion graphics, VFX, and vector graphics. These creative interests complement my technical skills, enabling me to combine functionality with aesthetic appeal in my projects. 

Furthermore, as a lecturer and researcher, my areas of expertise include Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), and Human Activity Recognition.
